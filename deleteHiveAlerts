'''

Script that works with thehive4py and theHive's elasticsearch api to:
1. Obtain a list of all alert ids
2. Use these ids to permantely delete the alerts

Use at your own risk! This will delete ALL alerts

Note:In testing, no negative consequneces found on cases that orignated from alerts.
Your experience may vary.

You could modify get_alerts to only obtain alerts created in a specific time frame using the Between query:
